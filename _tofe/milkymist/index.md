# Milkymist Compatibility - TOFE Expansion board

The [Numato Opsis board](https://numato.com/product/numato-opsis-fpga-based-open-video-platform)
is already very similar to the [Milkymist M1](http://m-labs.hk/m1.html) and
[Mixxeo](http://m-labs.hk/mixxeo.html) devices created by
[M-Labs](http://m-labs.hk/), but lacks the DJ hardware interfaces. This
expansion board adds these missing components.
