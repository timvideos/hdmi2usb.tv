        <p class="article">
          <p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>Hope everyone has had an awesome start to 2016 so far. As is tradition in many
western countries, I thought I would put together some 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution">New Year&#8217;s Resolutions</a>
and reflect on our progress in 2015. I guess more business minded people might
call it a &#8220;project roadmap&#8221; :-)</p>

<h3 id="timvideos-project">TimVideos Project</h3>

<p>In 2015, I decided to focus the <a href="https://code.timvideos.us">TimVideos project</a>
on the <a href="https://hdmi2usb.tv">HDMI2USB project</a>. The three key results of this
focus were;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Starting and completing a
<a href="https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-misoc-firmware">rewrite of the HDMI2USB firmware</a>
based on the
<a href="http://m-labs.hk/gateware.html">Migen and MiSoC system developed by M-Labs</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launching a
<a href="http://crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis">successful crowdfunding campaign</a>
for
<a href="https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-numato-opsis-hardware">Numato Opsis</a>,
our first open hardware for the HDMI2USB firmware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having the HDMI2USB firmware on Atlys boards used in production by multiple
people!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Carl Karsten from <a href="http://nextdayvideo.com">NextDayVideo</a> in the US for
both PyCon ZA and Nodevember.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam">DebConf Video team</a> for
their <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/gb/2015/MiniDebConfCambridge#Video">MiniDebConf in November</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mithro">Myself for recording</a> my own talks
on the HDMI2USB project at user groups here in Sydney!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the success of this focus in 2015, the TimVideos project is going to
continue to focus on the <a href="https://hdmi2usb.tv">HDMI2USB project</a> for 2016 (and
I&#8217;ll go into more detailed goals shortly).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://code.timvideos.us">TimVideos project</a> has also been mildly
successful in collaborating with other open source groups doing things related
to video recording and production. In 2016, I hope we can strengthen these
bonds and forge new ones. Some specific goals around this include;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Getting the TimVideos project to join 
<a href="https://sfconservancy.org">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> (or similar
organisation).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figure out the right way to collaborate with the
<a href="https://c3voc.de/">C3VOC team</a> on
<a href="https://github.com/voc/voctomix">voctomix</a> 
and start adding missing features from
<a href="https://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch">gst-switch</a>
allowing that project to be retired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to work with supporting groups like 
<a href="http://nextdayvideo.com">NextDayVideo</a>, the 
<a href="https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam">DebConf Video team</a> and 
<a href="https://linux.org.au">Linux Australia</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support and help 
<a href="http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects">Mike &#8220;Hamster&#8221; Field</a>
continue to develop a 
<a href="https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort">fully open source DisplayPort core</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaborate with the <a href="http://apertus.org">apertus° project</a> on high end (4k
and greater!) video capture and processing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hdmi2usb-project">HDMI2USB Project</h3>

<p>As we are concentrating on the HDMI2USB project, we have some specific goals
around that.</p>

<p>HDMI2USB <strong>firmware</strong> goals;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Refactor the HDMI core to allow support a wider range of interfaces, better
debugging and addition of more features. A document about the refactor has
been <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mithis.com/document/d/1L8lz7u2uj6MrzSQv4b1Vk6Rmic26okyRklOju5IWLYA/edit?usp=drive_web">started here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add support for the <a href="">high-speed GTP transceivers</a>
and <a href="http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects">Mike &#8220;Hamster&#8221; Field</a>
<a href="https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort">open source DisplayPort core</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Get Ethernet support working (on both the Atlys and Opsis boards). The two
major Ethernet features are;
    <ul>
      <li>Ethernet supports identical capture and control feature set to the USB
port.</li>
      <li>Allowing HDMI2USB boards to act has &#8220;HDMI over Ethernet extenders&#8221;.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://hdmi2usb.tv/potential-boards/">Support for more hardware</a>;
    <ul>
      <li>miniSpartan6+</li>
      <li>Digilent Nexys Video</li>
      <li>New HDMI2USB designed hardware!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stretch Goals (1)
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjM1Brrks0lg1CJp2Rt1BH8-MhJamrKUeCUB4s4nzoA/edit">hardware based mixing</a>.</li>
      <li>Have either a RTOS or Linux running on the FPGA softcore.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>HDMI2USB <strong>hardware</strong> goals;</p>

<ul>
  <li>(By end of year) Development of a low cost PCI-Express capture card.</li>
  <li>(By middle 2017) Development of an Opsis V2 based around either an high
end Artix-7 or a low end Kintex-7 FPGA.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(1): Stretch goals are things we plan to try and achieve if things go well.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Hope this update give you an idea of what we have planned for 2016! We would
love your help making it all possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello Backers,</p>

  <p>Firstly, I want to apologize for the radio silence since the campaign was
successfully funded – we have been super busy getting production up and
running and developing the tools needed to make using your Opsis and the new
expansion boards a great experience!</p>

  <p>On that note, we are planning on starting to ship the Opsis boards very soon.
We have had a couple of setbacks in the production process but are working
hard so that the majority of you still receive your boards before your
delivery date. The updated delivery schedule is as follows;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For the first 25 backers (with delivery marked as November or December), we
will be delivering the devices to Crowd Supply on the second week of January.</li>
    <li>For all the remaining backers and pre-orders (with delivery marked as
January, February, March or April), we will be delivering the devices to
Crowd Supply at the end of January / early February.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After the devices are received by Crowd Supply, they will endeavor to get
them shipped to backers ASAP. (For backers in India, the boards will be
shipped directly from Numato rather than through Crowd Supply.)</p>

  <p>There has also been some confusion delivery dates of the TOFE expansion
boards. Both types of expansion boards will ship <strong>with</strong> your Opsis board(s)
as one package.</p>

  <p>This also means that if you put in a pre-order before the end of December, we
will try and get it included in the second group so you should receive your
boards before the end of February!</p>

  <p>After boards are received by Crowd Supply, their crew will then shipped the
individual boards to backers. <strong>It is important that your shipping address is
correct <em>before</em> Crowd Supply start this process. Please check this now and
contact support to have it corrected if wrong.</strong></p>

  <p>Wishing everyone a happy holidays! </p>

  <p>Hello backers!</p>

  <p>Thank you everyone, at around 26 hours left in the campaign, we reached our
second stretch goal! You can now add the “Milkymist Compatibility” TOFE board
to your order at special introductory price of $35 USD. Because the campaign
is almost over, this price will be available after the campaign as a
“pre-order”, but only until 6pm Friday PDT (10/30). We have worked hard to
provide the board at our target price to Crowd Supply backers but the feature
set means it will be available at $50 USD after 10/30, get yours now!</p>

  <p>We are excited to enable interfacing with a wide range of controllers which
support DMX or MIDI. The audio support on the TOFE board should also provide
a lot of cool new possibilities that we haven’t previously thought about. The
“Milkymist Compatibility” board has the following confirmed features;</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC%2797">AC‘97 compatible audio interface</a> with Microphone, Headphones (on standard 3.5mm connectors) and Line In + Out (on screw terminals for permanent installations)</li>

  <p>Hello backers!</p>

  <p>Well you guys have done it, we have reached our first stretch goal and are
proud to announce the availability of the “Low Speed I/O” TOFE board! Just to
refresh your memory, here is what we said in our stretch goal update:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“While the Numato Opsis board has a massive amount of high speed I/O
interfaces, it doesn’t include many features for interfacing with more
pedestrian speed devices such as buttons or LEDs. To help solve this
problem, we are currently designing the “Low speed I/O” TOFE board.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The board can be <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis/updates/1834">added to your order</a>
at a discounted price of $20 USD until the campaign ends (when it will be
available for $25 USD).</p>

  <p>The “Low Speed I/O” board has the following confirmed features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><abbr title="Two of the Pmod headers share pins with the Arduino header. This means that when the Arduino compatible pin header is in use only 2 Pmod headers are available.*">1</abbr> x Arduino compatible pin header. The board includes an ADC meaning that even the analog pins should work.</li>
    <li>4 x Digilent Pmod™ Compatible headers[<abbr title="Two of the Pmod headers share pins with the Arduino header. This means that when the Arduino compatible pin header is in use only 2 Pmod headers are available.*">1</abbr>] to allow usage of existing expansion boards, including boards from Numato Lab, Digilent, Maxim and Analog.</li>
    <li>6 x Indicator LEDs</li>
    <li>4 x Push Buttons</li>
    <li><abbr title="Two of the Pmod headers share pins with the Arduino header. This means that when the Arduino compatible pin header is in use only 2 Pmod headers are available.*">1</abbr> x USB UART</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/c1f9/tofe-expansion-board_png_project-body.jpg" alt="Image1" /></p>

  <p>As this board adds Arduino shield compatibility, we are currently investigating
<a href="http://zpuino.blogspot.com/">ZPUino</a> <a href="http://www.alvie.com/zpuino/downloads/zpuino-1.0.pdf">(PDF user manual)</a>
to allow reusing existing Arduino code.</p>

  <p>The full schematic and PCB design can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-LowSpeedIO">timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-LowSpeedIO repository</a>.
We are also in the process of releasing a KiCad template for creating TOFE
expansion boards which will be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-kicad-template">timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-kicad-template repository</a> - we already
have people interested in working on both 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_digital_interface">SDI video</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-vmodvga">VGA expansion boards</a>.</p>

  <p>Last weekend, our friend 
<a href="http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects">Mike “Hamster” Field from HamsterWorks</a>
was successful in demonstrating what we believe is a FOSS world first! As the
pictures show, Mike has working 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noNqTdLYlEru_6gWOlFqFvYe-vctUE23Tp42oRoKKKo/pub#h.f52wag5243kp">4k video output</a>
(3840×2160p30) via 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noNqTdLYlEru_6gWOlFqFvYe-vctUE23Tp42oRoKKKo/pub#h.4m8ep0qk5gom">DisplayPort</a> using an open source core on open hardware.</p>

  <p>Mike has been hard at work 
<a href="https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort">implementing a fully open source DisplayPort core</a>,
so we were keen to get him an Numato Opsis board (we shipped him the third
board ever made). Currently his implementation is only using 2 of the 4 high
speed transceiver lanes on the Opsis but he is working on getting the other
two lanes working to effectively double the bandwidth and enabling full
3840×2160p60 (although Mike’s monitor doesn’t go that high, guess he needs a
new one :-). It has been awesome to be working with Mike and getting the
Opsis fully supported with his work.</p>

  <p>Over the next couple of weeks we should have some cool demos (plus less
blurry videos / screenshots!) and code samples which show how to make use of
this type of functionality as it can be tricky.</p>

  <p>Hi everyone,</p>

  <p>We have gotten a lot of questions about the video capabilities of 
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis">the Opsis board</a>
which is understandable because it took us ~3 years to understand the space!
To help clarify things we have
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noNqTdLYlEru_6gWOlFqFvYe-vctUE23Tp42oRoKKKo/pub">added a new FAQ</a> 
dealing exclusively with the details around HDMI, DisplayPort and the
revisions, resolutions and formats that the Opsis board supports.</p>

  <p>The important summary of the information is that on the Opsis;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The HDMI connectors support resolutions with equivalent bandwidth of SXGA @
60Hz (1280×1024 @ 60Hz progressive) which includes;
      <ul>
        <li>XGA@85Hz (1024×768 @ 85Hz progressive),</li>
        <li>1080p30 (1920×1080 @ 30Hz progressive),</li>
        <li>1080i60 (1920×1080 @ 60Hz interlaced),</li>
        <li>720p60 (1280×720 @ 60Hz progressive),</li>
        <li>but <strong>not</strong> 1080p60 (1920×1080 @ 60Hz progressive).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The DisplayPort connector supports resolutions up to a bandwidth of
~12Gbit/s which include extremely high resolutions like 4096 × 2160 @ 24Hz.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The DisplayPort connector is dual-mode enabled and thus <strong>can operate as high
speed HDMI ports</strong> using cheap adapters. When operating in HDMI modes, many
high resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz should work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you any feedback on the information, please comment on the 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noNqTdLYlEru_6gWOlFqFvYe-vctUE23Tp42oRoKKKo/edit">Google Docs version</a>
and we will try and get it incorporated into the CrowdSupply page.</p>

  <p>Hello Backers!</p>

  <p>With the campaign already at 144% and still a little under 5 weeks left, we
have been trying to come up with good ideas on how to keep the momentum
going. We want to get the Opsis board into the hands of as many people as
possible because it increases the number of cool things that happen. While we
are certain that you all will continue to spread the word, we thought that
some extra incentives couldn’t hurt!</p>

  <p>With that in mind, I’m happy to announce that with every 25 boards that are
ordered as part of the campaign, a stretch goal will be completed, unlocking
new purchase options or getting more stuff included with your Numato Opsis
board.</p>

  <h3 id="goal-1--25-boards---crowdfunding-campaign-is-successful-and-people-get-numato-opsis-boards">Goal 1 @ 25 boards - Crowdfunding campaign is successful and people get Numato Opsis boards</h3>
  <p>Already completed, you all rock!</p>

  <hr />

  <h3 id="goal-2---50-boards---unlock-the-low-speed-io-tofe-board-for-purchase">Goal 2 - 50 boards - Unlock the “Low speed I/O” TOFE board for purchase</h3>

  <p>While the Numato Opsis board has a massive amount of high speed I/O
interfaces, it doesn’t include many features for interfacing with more
pedestrian speed devices such as buttons or LEDs. To help solve this problem,
we are currently designing the “Low speed I/O” TOFE board. While the board
has yet to be finalized, the following features will probably be included;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An Arduino compatible pin header, allowing interfacing with most existing
Arduino expansion boards.</li>
    <li>Multiple PMOD headers, allowing interfacing with many existing boards from
a wide range of manufactures, including Numato.</li>
    <li>A number of indicator LEDs.</li>
    <li>A number of push button and toggle switches.</li>
    <li>When more than 50 boards are ordered from the campaign, we’ll open up the
purchase of this board for $25USD.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h3 id="goal-3---75-boards---unlock-the-milkymist-compatibility-tofe-board-for-purchase">Goal 3 - 75 boards - Unlock the “Milkymist Compatibility” TOFE board for purchase</h3>

  <p>The Numato Opsis is already very similar to the Milkymist and Mixxeo devices
created by M-Labs. It is however missing a couple of features those boards
have. This TOFE board is designed to cover those remaining missing features
and will include;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>AC-97 compatible audio interface.</li>
    <li>Two DMX512 (RS485) ports</li>
    <li>MIDI IN and MIDI OUT ports</li>
    <li>Infrared receiver and sender</li>
    <li>RS232 compatible serial port</li>
    <li>A number of push buttons</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When more than 75 boards are ordered from the campaign, we’ll open up the purchase of this board for $35USD.</p>

  <hr />

  <h3 id="goal-4---100-boards---everyone-gets-a-low-speed-io-tofe-board-with-their-numato-opsis-board">Goal 4 - 100 boards - Everyone gets a “Low speed I/O” TOFE board with their Numato Opsis board!</h3>

  <p>If more than 100 boards are ordered from the campaign, we will have hit a
large enough economy of scale that we can include one of the “Low speed I/O”
TOFE board with every Numato Opsis board order.</p>

  <p>People will be able to add either one of the boards to their existing
purchase for free. People who had already ordered the TOFE board will have
the option of being refunded their money.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I hope that gets everyone even more excited about the Numato Opsis board and
what you can do with them. We really want to do all these things, so it is up
to you to get the word out! The campaign page will be updated shortly.</p>

  <p>Hello Backers!</p>

  <p>With the campaign already over 120%, we know that some of you are super
impatient to get your hands on an Opsis board and might be happy to live on
the bleeding edge. We have a limited number of “pre-production” boards left
over from the prototyping run and rather than having them sit around
collecting dust, would like to send them to people who will do cool things
with them! Hence we are happy to announce the “Numato Opsis Champion”
program.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis">Order a Numato Opsis board at CrowdSupply.com</a>,
then tell us about your project and why you can’t wait by filling out this
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/crowdsupply.com/forms/d/1gt6ZKw6CgtVWSvxZXw4ge9V1E58OUiKtlQLrKHmdLWk/viewform">Google Form</a>
before Friday, 2nd October ends 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a>. The form has only 3
short questions for you to fill out! For the best entries, we will ship a
pre-production board for free. As these boards are already manufactured, they
will ship well before the campaign ends! Winners will of course also receive
their ordered production board like every other backer.</p>

  <p>We don’t have any set criteria for evaluating the entries but are looking for
people who are going to do something awesome or something which helps the
community. Anything from helping write sample code, porting existing projects
to the board, using the board for event capture or in some type of artwork or
performance, to even just plugging the board into everything you can find are
all potential winners. We are sure we haven’t even imagined some of the cool
things you will come up with.</p>

  <p>As you will be receiving a pre-production Opsis, well before our planned
shipping date, you need to be prepared to deal with things like incomplete
documentation, missing or incomplete tooling and sample code, things which
just plain don’t work. Please understand the ride will be bumpier than what
people will get when receiving the production boards. These prototyping
boards are functional but did require some small manual fix ups to work
correctly (which have already been done by us) and are a bit rougher than the
final boards.</p>

  <p>Look forward to hearing about all the cool things you want to do!</p>

  <p>Cheers, TimVideos &amp; Numato Lab</p>

  <p>The goal has been reached a full month in advance before the campaign end, we
are humbled by the overwhelmingly positive feedback and interest in the
Numato Opsis.</p>

  <p>Thank you for all the support but the campaign is not over yet - we have just
over 5 more weeks to go.</p>

  <p>We are also hanging out in the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=timvideos">#timvideos channel on the Freenode IRC</a>

  <p>Firstly, I’d like to say thank you for your all your support so far! It’s
awesome to see that we have reached over 60% of our goal after only being up
for a week.</p>

  <p>A number of people who are unable to purchase a board have asked how they can
support the project so we put together the following list:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>We now have a “Support Us!” pledge level on the crowdfunding page which
allows you to donate money towards getting the board into production.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The crowdfunding campaign is extremely dependent on people knowing about it!
Please share the crowdfunding campaign page on Twitter, Facebook, Google+
and anywhere else that is appropriate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Help out with development! We have a wide variety of things which need to be
done from coding tasks, system administration, web design, helping with
documentation and much more. Most tasks don’t require you to have any
hardware and many don’t require any coding!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Join our mailing lists and IRC channel and continue to be excited about the
project. Seeing all the people that are excited makes us excited to do even
more cool things.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://m-labs.hk/gateware.html">the m-labs&#8217;s site</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1 id="migen">Migen</h1>

  <p>Migen is a Python-based tool that automates further the VLSI design process.</p>

  <p>Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and
VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven
model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for
synchronous circuits, which represent the lion&#8217;s share of today&#8217;s logic
designs.  Counter-intuitive arithmetic rules result in steeper learning
curves and provide a fertile ground for subtle bugs in designs. Finally,
support for procedural generation of logic (metaprogramming) through
&#8220;generate&#8221; statements is very limited and restricts the ways code can be made
generic, reused and organized.</p>

  <p>To address those issues, we have developed the Migen FHDL library that
replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and
synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave
like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design&#8217;s logic to
be constructed by a Python program. This last point enables hardware
designers to take advantage of the richness of the Python language - object
oriented programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading,
libraries, etc. - to build well organized, reusable and elegant designs.</p>

  <p>Other Migen libraries are built on FHDL and provide various tools such as a
system-on-chip interconnect infrastructure, a dataflow programming system, a
more traditional high-level synthesizer that compiles Python routines into
state machines with datapaths, and a simulator that allows test benches to be
written in Python.</p>

  <p>You can find the <a href="http://github.com/m-labs/migen">Migen source here</a>,
released under the permissive BSD license.</p>

  <h1 id="misoc">MiSoC</h1>

  <p>Built on Migen, MiSoC provides a high performance, flexible and lightweight
solution to build system-on-chips for various applications.</p>

SDRAM bandwidth, 1080p 32bpp framebuffer, etc.</li>
    <li>Low resource usage: basic implementation fits easily in Spartan-6 LX9.</li>
    <li>Portable and easy to customize thanks to Python- and Migen-based architecture.</li>
    <li>Design new peripherals using Migen and benefit from automatic CSR maps and
logic, simplified DMAs, etc.</li>
    <li>Possibility to encapsulate legacy Verilog/VHDL code.</li>
  </ul>

          Jul 1, 2015
          
          
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          <p>The <a href="http://code.timvideos.us/">TimVideos project</a> and <a href="http://numato.com/">Numato
Lab</a> are pleased to announce the Numato &#8220;Opsis&#8221; open video
platform. The Opsis platform is an exciting new FPGA based open hardware,
specifically designed for the needs of the HDMI2USB project.</p>

<p>With dual inputs and dual outputs, which can all be controlled independently,
the board removes the need for extra matrix switching hardware, reducing
complexity of recording set up.</p>

<p>The HDMI2USB firmware is also designed to provide a large amount debugging
information which is all programmatically available by a virtual serial port.
The Opsis board enables even further support by including full control over all
pins, including hot plug, enabling &#8220;virtual disconnection&#8221; without having to
unplug and re-plug cables.</p>

<p>The TimVideos project is already experimenting with the new functionality
available through the Opsis board and is currently investigating new features
like streaming video directly via Gigabit Ethernet or capturing live to a local
SD card.</p>

<p>The Opsis board has also been targeted at people interested and involved with
video creation, manipulation and research. The Opsis board&#8217;s features enables a
wide range of video related applications and is designed not only for
development but to become the core of your intelligent digital video system.
Potential integration applications include everything from a simple &#8220;smart&#8221;
video matrix to live video manipulation in visual art installations. </p>

<p>Overall, the new <a href="">Opsis board</a> has the following differences with the 
<a href="">Atlys board</a> used for prototyping.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Has DDR3 memory instead of DDR2, increasing the memory bandwidth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a Spartan S6LX45T with the GTP broken out to DisplayPort headers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a PCI-Express style expansion connector instead of the expensive VHDCI
connector, allow much cheaper expansion boards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has all the extra pins on the FX2, increasing the potential USB interface
options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has control over all the HDMI functionality, including hot plug and CEC
functionality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removes parts we don’t need such as the audio, buttons, switches and LEDs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mounts in any ITX style computer case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds UTMI USB (as well as the Cypress FX2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds MicroSD connector.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Carl enjoying a drink after a long flight</p>
</div>

<p>When he boarded the plane in San Francisco, Google Summer of Code mentor Carl
knew he was going to miss one of the world&#8217;s most well-documented annual
events. It was New Year&#8217;s Eve and thanks to the international dateline, Carl
would arrive in Auckland, New Zealand (aka Middle Earth) on the morning of
January 2. While he was sacrificing his chance to capture the fireworks, the
work that Carl and a team of GSoC mentors and students were converging to
tackle would empower others to record something more enduring than those sky
sparkles.</p>

<p>When he arrived in the &#8220;land of the long white cloud&#8221; Carl met with
<a href="http://dreamsxtrinsic.blogspot.com.au/">Rohit</a> and
<a href="http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com.au/">Ajit</a>, two GSoC 2014 students who had
travelled even further but in the opposite direction, leaving from India. Rohit
was venturing overseas for the first time.  In the following days, the group
was joined by GSoC 2015 student <a href="http://hyades.github.io">Aayush</a>, also from
India, and GSoC mentor <a href="http://blog.mithis.net">Tim</a>, from Australia.</p>

</div>

<p>The GSoC participants and many others involved in the
<a href="http://code.timvideos.us/">TimVideos.us</a> project were converging for a
week-long coding sprint ahead of the <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> conference, where they would
put their work to the test with video capture and streaming.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.timvideos.us/">TimVideos.us</a> is a group of projects that create a
system for doing both recording and live streaming for presentations at events
such as conferences, meetups, and user groups. The projects include both open
source software and open source hardware development. The aim is to reduce the
costs and expertise required to produce live streaming events to near zero. One
of the major goals for the project over the past two years has been to replace
an old standard definition system based on end-of-life hardware with a new,
high definition, completely FOSS solution.</p>

<p>Thanks to the massive effort of GSoC students in 2013 and 2014, and with help
from many other volunteers, the projects were getting close to serving their
intended purpose. The sprinters hoped to get the tools to the stage where they
could start experimenting with them during the conference. </p>

<p>GSoC students had been fundamental in getting the systems ready, so it made
sense to give GSoC students the opportunity to use their code and hardware in
the high-stress environment of a conference. There&#8217;s nothing like a trial by
fire.</p>

<p>The sprint was extremely productive, the group sent 54 pull requests and closed
27 issues. The sprints focused on two of the TimVideos projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch">gst-switch</a>, a software video mixer
based around gstreamer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://hdmi2usb.tv">HDMI2USB</a>, open hardware and firmware for capturing
HDMI and DVI streams from a projector. <a href="http://jms.id.au/">Joel</a>, Ajit&#8217;s
mentor in 2014, gave a talk about the HDMI2USB project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After the sprints the conference began, and the real challenges with it. Given
the importance of ensuring video was actually captured, the team set up the
old, proven pipeline.</p>

<p><a href="http://linux.conf.au">Linux.conf.au</a> is the biggest FOSS conference in the
Oceania region and attracts people from around the world, including luminaries
such as Linus Torvalds. The conference is in a different city each year,
generally in Australia but occasionally in New Zealand as in 2015. While
travelling from Australia to New Zealand is relatively easy for Australians,
the extra cost of a passport can mean some aren&#8217;t able to attend, so live
streaming was provided to allow those people to view the proceedings.</p>

<p>Many of the conference talks are important to the FOSS community globally, so
the presentations are all recorded and shared freely under a CC-BY-SA license.
Reliable, high quality recordings are important to facilitate this sharing.
They are all freely available on the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/linuxconfau2015">Linux.conf.au 2015 YouTube channel</a>
or via the 
<a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2015">Linux.org.au mirror</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A number of organisations came together to facilitate this work. There was
funding from Linux.conf.au, Google Conference grants for the GSoC students, a
venue provided by Catalyst IT and a donation from Tim. These folks deserve a
huge thank you for making such awesomeness possible.</p>
